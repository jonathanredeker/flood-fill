# Flood Fill
A Flood Fill pathfinding algorithm on a two-dimensional array

## flood_fill.py

### To-do
- [x] Solve bug that allows the player to traverse between two diagonally adjacent obstacles:
```
P - Player
O - Obstacle
      
[P][O]    [ ][O]
[O][ ] => [O][P]
```
- [ ] Allow the algorithm to check a non-rectangular/uneven map
- [ ] Optimize for speed; current execution time is 150ms

Let's visit another dimension! How about 3D space?
